# CP-Project-Proposal

Koda Bryant

Summary: My project is going to be a randomly generated interactive painting that is going to be projected onto a wall or canvas or something similar. The image will be created using a camera on a monitor. The data that it collects will determine how the image turns out. 

Right now my idea (generally) is to create a grid over the area that the camera sees, and then program rules that relate to certain colors or shapes or movements.


Physical / Parts Components: computer monitor with camera, projector

decontructions/ system diagram: ???

Whatâ€™s going to be hard / uncertain: I have never really worked with video or projections, but I've seen it used a lot. I think it will kind of be like starting from scratch and learning a new thing for me but i'm sure it can be done.
