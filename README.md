# CP-Project-Proposal

Koda Bryant

## Summary:
My project is going to be a randomly generated, interactive painting that is going to be projected onto a wall or a canvas or something similar. The image is going to be created using whatever data the camera detects. That data will determine how the image changes and moves, using things like the colors of the pictured peoples clothes, the placement of them on the camera, and if they are moving to decide what shapes and colors to use.
Right now my idea (generally) is to create a grid over the area that the camera sees, and then program rules for every section that relate to certain colors or shapes or movements.


## Physical / Parts Components:

Computer monitor with camera, Projector

## Decontructions/ system diagram: 

???

## Whatâ€™s going to be hard / uncertain: 
I have never really worked with video or projections, but I've seen it used a lot. I think it will kind of be like starting from scratch and learning a new thing for me but i'm sure it can be done.
